## 🔍 Overview

Sync-project is a lightweight bash script that simplifies the deployment process for WordPress themes, plugins, and custom web projects. It uses rsync to efficiently transfer only the changed files to your server, making deployments fast and reliable.

## ✨ Features

- **Universal compatibility**: Works with WordPress plugins, themes, and custom web projects
- **Efficient transfers**: Uses rsync to only transfer changed files
- **Dry run mode**: Preview changes before actual deployment
- **Secure**: Supports SSH key-based authentication (recommended)
- **Customizable**: Easily configure exclusions for files you don't want to sync
- **Simple setup**: Just copy the script to your project root and configure

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Bash shell environment
- SSH access to your server
- rsync installed on both local and remote systems
- Optional: sshpass (only if using password authentication, not recommended)

## 📋 Setup Instructions

1. Copy `sync-project.sh` to your project's root folder
2. Edit the SERVER DETAILS section in the script with your credentials:
   ```bash
   SERVER_IP="your-server-ip"               # e.g. 192.168.1.100 or server.example.com
   SERVER_USER="your-ssh-user"             # e.g. wp-admin, deploy
   PROJECT_TYPE="plugin"                   # plugin, theme, or custom
   DEST_DIR="/path/to/wordpress/wp-content" # Base WordPress content directory
   CUSTOM_DEST_DIR=""                      # Only used if PROJECT_TYPE="custom"
   ```
3. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x sync-project.sh
   ```

## 🔐 Authentication Methods

### Recommended: SSH Key-based Authentication

1. Generate an SSH key pair if you don't have one:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
   ```
2. Copy your public key to the server:
   ```bash
   ssh-copy-id user@server
   ```

### Alternative: Password Authentication (not recommended)

1. Install sshpass (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   # On macOS with Homebrew
   brew install hudochenkov/sshpass/sshpass
   
   # On Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install sshpass
   ```
2. Uncomment and set the PASSWORD variable in the script

## 📝 Usage

### Preview Changes (Dry Run)

```bash
./sync-project.sh --dry-run
```

### Deploy to Server

```bash
./sync-project.sh
```

## 🔧 Customization

    "--exclude=.git/"
    "--exclude=.gitignore"
    "--exclude=docs/"
    "--exclude=*.zip"
    "--exclude=*.md"
    "--exclude=*.log"
    "--exclude=node_modules/"
    "--exclude=vendor/"
    "--exclude=tests/"
    "--exclude=sync-project.sh"
)
```
